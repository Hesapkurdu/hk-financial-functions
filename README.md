## Description

As a lead online financial aggregator , we have to calculate every customer needs with certain accuracy.
We used to use a different nuget library for this kind of calculations [ExcelFinancialFunctions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ExcelFinancialFunctions/)
But this library written F#, it's hard to extend or understand what's happening in it.
So we converted base financial functions from F# to C# and pack it with nuget so everbody can use it.
